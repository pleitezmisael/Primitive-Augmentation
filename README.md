# Primitive-Augmentation

My name is Misael Pleitez,  I am working on my degree project called Primitive Augmentation. Augmented Reality is being absorbed and adopted into architectural practice as a new method of visualization. This positions the augmented object as a replacement for an unrealized Architectural model rather than making a physical model. My thesis, Primitive Augmentation, is a base for development of architectural models in augmented reality. The interest into AR allows for the use of architectural objects to display realistic experiences and for interactions through space. Primitive Augmentation is a argument towards practical architecture as a display that computer-based design(s) are the “Real Project,” while architectural models and 2D drawings are representational to design. The use of simple geometry allows for the user-interface to be easier to access and interact with for users who do not have a design background. My plug-in lets the user create their own circulation path that has primitive geometry moving through the spaces created for different experiences.
